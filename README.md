# Capstone Project

This repository consists of the proposal, data, code, and report for Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project.
**Area: Investment and Trading**
**Project: Build a Stock Price Indicator**

In this capstone project, I leveraged the knowledge gained from Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.

## Project description
A stock price indicator was built using machine learning in this capstone project.

Investment firms, hedge funds and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. A wealth of information is available in the form of historical stock prices and company performance data, suitable for machine learning algorithms to process.

For this project, I built a stock price predictor that takes daily trading data over a certain date range as input, and outputs projected estimates for given query dates. 

## Folders and Files
- **[`data`](https://github.com/chaitanyakasaraneni/InvestAndTrade_MLND/tree/master/data)**: This folder contains the data files used for Investment and Trading Project. All the files are in `.csv` format
- **[`stockAnalysis_and_Predictions.ipynb`](https://github.com/chaitanyakasaraneni/InvestAndTrade_MLND/blob/master/stockAnalysis_and_Predictions.ipynb)**: This file contains code for exploring the data, processing the data, and predicting stock prices
- **[`proposal.pdf`](https://github.com/chaitanyakasaraneni/InvestAndTrade_MLND/blob/master/proposal.pdf)**: This file contains the proposal (approved) for this project

## Data Collection
The data used in this project is collected from **[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com)** website. You can directly query for a stock through the web API, or download a dump of .csv files and use them.
If you want to download the data, follow the below steps
 - Search the company for which you want to download the data
 - Select the `Historical Data` tab
 - Click Download to get the data in `.csv` format

*Coming in future: A fully developed and deployed web application using flask*
